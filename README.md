SICP
====

This repository hosts code and notes for SICP exercises. It may not be fully
comprehensive, as some of the theoritical exercises I will do on paper and will
probably feel too lazy to digitize the solutions, and some other exercises I 
will pass over... (More specifically the ones in the earlier chapters which
I already glossed over in my previous attemp of going through the book)

It probably will end up containing a mixture of Chicken Scheme and Racket code.

Notes
=====

* The section about efficient exponentiation took me to revisit Project 
Euler problem 122, which in turn took me to learn about addition chains...
What a ride for a Sunday afternoon!
