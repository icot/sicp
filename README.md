SICP
====

This repository hosts code and notes for SICP exercises. It may not be fully
comprehensive, as some of the theoritical exercises I will do on paper and will
probably feel too lazy to digitize the solutions, and some other exercises I 
will pass over...

It probably will end up containing a mixture of Chicken Scheme and Racket code.
